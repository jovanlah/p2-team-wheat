# Suggested Improvements

1. **Add a Legend**: Ensure the legend is clear and visible, associating each color with the corresponding messaging app.

2. **Color-Blind** Friendly Palette: Use a color-blind friendly palette to ensure the map is accessible to all viewers. Or you can use different patterns/shades instead of relying solely on color.

3. **Clear Title and Description**: Update the title to be more descriptive, such as "Most Popular Messaging Apps by Country (June 2024)". Include a subtitle explaining the criteria for determining the most popular app.

4. **Data Source and Date Visibility**: Place the data source and date information prominently near the title or in a footer to ensure it's easily visible.

5. **Highlight Key Insights**: Add annotations or highlights to point out interesting patterns or notable exceptions in the data. E.g., highlight regions where less common apps like imo or Kakaotalk are the top choice.

6. **Use of Borders and Labels**: Ensure country borders are clear and labeled appropriately to help users easily identify regions. Include country names or ISO codes to assist with identification.
